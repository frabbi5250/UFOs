# UFOs
JavaScript enables interactivity on websites when using HTML. It helps developers to build modern web applications in order to interact directly without reloading the pages. JavaScript is commonly used to modify HTML. The goal of this project was to create a webpage with a table consisting of filtered UFO sightings data results. The original webpage was created with a date filter along with city, state, country, and shape.
